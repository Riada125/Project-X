## Overview <img src=src/HomerTransparent.png width= 200px>
I think that the first 12(ish) seasons of The Simpsons is some of the best TV ever created. Tasked with creating a very simple, single-page React app that consumes a public API - I was pleased to discover that a [Simpsons Quote API](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/) exists!


## Brief
- Create a single-page React app that talks to an API and displays some data
- Use a public API
- Style it nicely
- Finally, deploy your project with `npm run build`; `npm run deploy`
